## Count Counter
This is a simple counter application that supports incrementing a counter value. Since it uses BigInteger there is no real limit to how far it can count, but *only* 12 606 characters are able to be seen in the GUI. See the [maximum_counter_value_example](./maximum_counter_value_example.txt) for an example of the length limitation. 

NOTE: You can still achieve a greater count than in the example by counting so that all numbers are exclusively 9s, but beyond that will not be displayed correctly in the GUI.
